Name:Traffic Density- Annual Vehicle Miles Traveled,Measure:million miles (per km2),How Calculated:The average number of vehicles traveling on a road segment on any given day during the year was estimated for each segment in a geography. The number of vehicles was multiplied by length of road segment to arrive at a daily vehicle-miles measure for that segment. The daily vehicle-miles measures were summed across all segments in a geography and then multiplied by 365 to arrive at an annual measure. Vehicle-miles are expressed in millions per square kilometer.,Source(s):New York Metropolitan Transpor,Year:2016,
